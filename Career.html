		<div id='Job'>
			<h2> Job and Responsabilities</h2>
			<p> Taking into account the growth of the technology and data sector, graduate students with a degree in computer science will be able to find a job in a variety of fields. Many computer science professionals work for industries in research and development or computer systems design, work for the federal government. Some possible career options include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Control system scientist</li>
				<li>Scientific programmer analyst</li>
				<li>Software developer</li>
				<li>Data scientist</li>
			</ul>
			<p> The definition of a computer engineer, by the National Society Of Profesional Engineers (NSPE), is someone who works on computer hardware and software in the design, construction and operation of computer systems. It is important to highlight that hardware and software are integral to each other, so engineers who specialize in one area must still have a strong understanding of the other.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='qualifications'>
			<h2> Qualifications Needed</h2>
			<p>Becoming a succesful computer scientist who works in research, typically needs a Ph.D. in computer science or a related fields, such as computer engineering or information systems. Usually, this degree normaly requires 4 to 5 years of additional study after the completion of a bachelor's degree in a similar field.<br>
			If you want to work in a specialized field of computer science, you will need knowledge of that field. For example, computer scientists that work in biomedical applications may have to take some biology classes.<br>
			If you want to get an entry-level job in computer science, a bachelor's degree in computer science is sufficient.</p>
		</div>
		<div id='Outlook'>
			<h2> Future Possibilities</h2>
			<p><br>The employment outlook will be good for Computer engineers (National Ocupation Classification 2147) in Ontario for the 2017-2019 period.
			The following factors contributed to this outlook:<p>
			<ul>
			<li>Employment growth will lead to several new positions.</li>
			<li>A moderate number of positions will become available due to retirements.</li>
			<li>There are a small number of unemployed workers with recent experience in this occupation.</li>
		</ul>

		<div id='why'>
			<h2>Why would I choose this career?</h2>
			<p>I noticed through the progress of my research that looking for what a computer scientist who works in the engineering side does is really complicated. I tried to narrow down as much as I could but my ignorace did not let me find specifically the information I needed easily. When I went through the <a class='in-text' href='https://admissions.carleton.ca/programs/'>Carleton University</a> website, I noticed that there are Computer Scientist that go through the Software engineering stream, Software engineering from the engineering faculty, as well as Computer Systems engineering. All of them have the word 'Engineering' in them!<br>
			My goal is to improve technology that exists today by studyding computer science to deeply understand the factors that are involved in the devices we, the users, take for granted today. As well as implement computers more efficiently and clear for the human eye.</p>
