			<h1>How does this career fulfills the vocation that God has called me to do?</h1>
			<p> If you see the reason why <a class='in-text' href='./Career.html/#why'>I would choose this career,</a> it might be noticed my ideal of better technologies for the humanity as a united group.<br>
			I like to think that my purpose in life is to meaningfully gather people to fill needs each other has and work as a group. My problem is that as it was concluded before, the human is not efficient running by itself but is the most efficient being if it rides a bicycle. Taking this into account, computers allow me to function properly and efficiently (as my personality is broken) towards achieving the common good for everybody, around daily life computers, which have been becoming useful tools for every obstacle that has to be challenged. Adding to this, computers are everywhere and will continue to diverse in many ways as developers imagine. Being able to work with these, can benefit others by lowering the level of difficutly that nowadays processes conceive.<br>
			I like working in this kind of tasks. It is for my enjoyment that it is the homework that I like to do and if I'm happy then I am able to make people around me happy.<br>
