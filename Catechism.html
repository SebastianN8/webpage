			<h1>How does this career fulfills the vocation that God has called me to do?</h1>
			<p> If you see the reason why <a class='in-text' href='./Career.html/#why'>I would choose this career,</a> it might be noticed my ideal of better technologies for the humanity as a united group.<br><br>
			I like to think that my purpose in life is to meaningfully gather people to fill each different need they have and function as a group. My problem is that as it was concluded before, the human is not efficient running by itself but is the most efficient being if it rides a bicycle. Taking this into account, computers allow me to function properly and productively (as my personality is broken) towards accomplishing the common benefit for all, around daily life computers, which have been becoming useful tools for every obstacle that has to be challenged.<br><br>

			Adding to this, computers are everywhere and will continue to diverse in various ways as developers envision. Having the capacity to work with these, can profit others by lowering the level of difficulty that nowadays processes conceive.<br><br>

			I enjoy working on these kinds of tasks. It is for my enjoyment that this is the homework that I have and I appreciate it. If I am happy then I am able to make others around me happy.
