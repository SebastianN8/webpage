			<h2>Entrance Requirements</h2>
			<p> To get into Computer Science in Carleton University, the applicant needs to have achieved an overall grade of 78% to 82% on Advanced Functions or Calculus if he/she is applying for an honours. But the interested people can also apply to a major in Computer Science if he/she desires.</p>

			<h2> Courses First year </h2>
			<p> The program of Computer Science is divided into seven streams, which are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Algorithms</li>
				<li>Computer and Internet Security</li>
				<li>Computer Game Development</li>
				<li>Management and Bussines Systems</li>
				<li>Mobile Computing</li>
				<li>Network Computing</li>
				<li>Software Engineering</li>
			</ul>
			<p> All the streams share a common core of computer science courses. No matter what stream is choosen by the applicant, he or she will gain epertise in all the fundamentals, including programming, algorithms, software engineering, databases and user interfaces.</p>
			<p> The first year courses are COMP 1405 which is an introduction to computer science, which goes through the firts stepts of critical thinking in programing (variables, conditionals, etc). Also, students take MATH 1007, which is the basics of calculus starting by limits. Then, they have COMP 1805, a course that goes through the topics propositional logic, predicate calculus, set theory, complexity of algorithms, mathematical reasoning and proof techniques, recurrences, induction, finite automata and graph theory. In addition to this, COMP 1406 is a second course in programming. It assumes that you are familiar with programming and builds on that knowledge by introducing object-oriented programming concepts. Finally, there is MATH 1104, which is linear algebra.</p>
